			<h1>CONSERVATION AREAS</h1>
			<p>Areas declared for the purpose of managing and conserving natural, cultural, or historical resources are referred to as protected areas. These spaces have been set aside
				 to protect ecosystems, wildlife, and important historical or cultural elements. Maintaining the natural balance, safeguarding endangered species, and reducing human influence while offering possibilities for scientific research, 
				education, and recreation are the fundamental objectives.Protected areas are necessary to reduce human impact, preserve natural equilibrium, and conserve biodiversity. They play a vital role in maintaining the health of Earth by acting as centers for environmental education, recreation, and research.
